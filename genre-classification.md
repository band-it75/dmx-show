Thanks for the clarification. I’ll now perform a full audit of the `band-it75/dmx-show` repository to identify what is broken or incomplete and propose concrete improvements.

This will include a review of the genre classification logic, DMX control flow, model integration, scenario mapping, error handling, and how it matches your available lighting hardware.

I’ll get back to you shortly with findings and suggested improvements.


## Genre Classification Pipeline

* **Model Loading & Output:** The audio genre classifier is initialized to load a local Hugging Face model from `models/music_genres_classification`. If this folder is missing or PyTorch/TensorFlow isn’t installed, the classifier will raise an exception on startup. In operation, the model is loaded lazily on first use (with a console message if `verbose=True`). Ensure the model is properly downloaded (e.g. by running the provided PowerShell script to `snapshot_download` the model) and that `torch` is installed, so the genre model actually loads. To verify predictions, run the system with `GenreClassifier(verbose=True)` – on song start it should print a genre label to confirm the model’s inference.
* **Mapping to Scenarios:** The classifier’s top label is converted to a lighting scenario in `_scenario_from_label`. This covers known cases (“rock”, “metal”, “jazz”, “pop/disco”, etc.) and defaults to the *Slow* scenario for other genres. This logic matches the intended design (e.g. a “hip hop” label also maps to the slow scenario by default). No major issues were found here, **however** if the model returns an unexpected label or an empty result, it could fall back to *Slow* every time. Testing with real audio is recommended to ensure the predicted labels align with expectations (e.g. that a rock song actually yields a label containing “rock”). If not, consider refining the mapping (for example, if the model outputs “dance” for pop songs, add a rule for “dance” -> Pop scenario).
* **Threaded Classification & Error Handling:** Genre classification runs in a background thread when a song is recognized as “ONGOING”. The implementation appropriately avoids blocking the real-time beat loop by using a thread. One issue is that any exception during model inference is caught and only printed if the dashboard is **off**. In the normal dashboard mode, a failure (e.g. model file not found or a runtime error) will be **silent** – the genre stays blank with no log. **Improvement:** Add an error log or dashboard indicator if the genre thread fails. For instance, always print the exception or set a special genre label like “(error)” on failure. This way, model issues won’t fail quietly.

## BPM Fallback & Scenario Logic

* **No Fallback on Missing Genre:** The system does not currently use BPM to choose a lighting scenario if genre classification doesn’t provide one. There is a helper `scenario_for_bpm()` defined, categorizing BPM ranges for each *Song Ongoing* scenario, but it’s never called in the current code. In practice, if the genre label remains empty or the classification thread crashes, the show remains in the *“Song Start”* lighting state for the entire song (since no scenario update is applied). This can be seen when a song continues without a genre – the `last_genre` stays `None`, and `_set_scenario` is never called to move beyond the initial state. **Improvement:** Implement a fallback to select a scenario after a certain time if no genre is set. For example, after a few seconds of ONGOING state, use `scenario_for_bpm(avg_bpm)` to pick a scenario based on tempo. This ensures lighting doesn’t get stuck in the intro state. Even a simple default (e.g. assume *Slow* or use the last known genre) would be better than staying in *Song Start*. Logging a warning when genre classification fails and applying a default scenario (perhaps indicated on the dashboard) would make the behavior clear.
* **Scenario Transition Rules:** The finite-state logic for scenarios may be overly strict, causing some transitions to be ignored. The `_set_scenario` method only allows a scenario change if it’s in the predefined predecessor/successor lists. In practice, this prevents certain “jumps” that do happen in real shows. For example, a song that ends before any genre was set means the system is in *Song Start* scenario when transitioning to ending; since *Song Start* is not listed as a predecessor of *Song Ending*, the call to switch scenarios is aborted. Similarly, if music resumes during a *Song Ending* (e.g. a quiet bridge that fooled the detector), the attempt to go back to *Song Start* scenario is ignored because *Song Ending* isn’t a valid predecessor for *Song Start*. The result is that lighting cues for these state changes don’t execute – e.g. house lights might not come up at an abrupt end, or they stay on if a song restarts quickly. **Improvement:** Loosen the transition restrictions for critical states. We can allow *Song Start* -> *Song Ending* and vice versa, or simply force those transitions in code. One approach is to call `_set_scenario(..., force=True)` for transitions at song boundaries (STARTING, ENDING, INTERMISSION) so that important cues always fire. Another approach is to add `"SONG_START"` to the predecessor list of *SONG\_ENDING*, and `"SONG_ENDING"` as a predecessor of *SONG\_START* in the `Scenario` enum definition, to explicitly permit those transitions. This would prevent the lighting state machine from getting “stuck” in an inappropriate scenario when songs start or stop unexpectedly.

## Audio Buffering and Timing

* **Audio Capture for Classification:** Ensure that enough audio data is collected before running genre classification. Currently, as soon as the song state transitions to ONGOING, `_start_genre_classification()` is invoked immediately. This means the model might get only \~2 seconds of audio (the minimum needed to go from STARTING to ONGOING) to determine the genre. There is code to accumulate 5 seconds of audio in `self.audio_buffer`, but in practice the immediate trigger on state change clears the buffer and starts the thread with whatever audio was captured in the first moments. **Improvement:** Consider delaying genre classification until a bit more audio is buffered. One strategy is to remove the immediate call on state change and rely on the buffer threshold (5 seconds) to trigger the thread, ensuring the model gets a richer sample. Alternatively, you could start the thread immediately but feed it a longer window of audio – e.g. by continuing to collect for a couple more seconds before actually running the model. The goal is to improve genre prediction accuracy by analyzing a “few seconds” of audio as intended, rather than possibly a very short clip.
* **Beat Sync and Latency:** The beat detection uses small 512-sample blocks (\~11.6 ms) to detect transients and compute features. This gives responsive timing, but also a heavy CPU load due to computing FFTs and spectral features every 512 samples. If the system struggles with this, the audio queue can fill and start dropping packets (the code catches a `queue.Full` in the audio callback and simply discards the audio chunk). Dropped audio frames could cause missed beats or inaccurate BPM readings. **Recommendation:** Monitor the `audio_queue` length or the CPU usage; if there are many drops, consider increasing the block size (e.g. 1024 or 2048 samples) to reduce callback frequency, or optimize the feature computations (perhaps downsample for chorus/crescendo detection). Also, since the DMX output is sent at a fixed 30 FPS, a slight increase in audio buffer size won’t harm reactivity noticeably. Ensuring the audio processing thread keeps up will maintain better sync between detected beats and lighting commands.
* **Timing Alignment:** The use of `pre_send` callback in the DMX thread is a smart design – it updates the overhead dimmer based on the latest VU level right before each frame is sent. This ensures the lights respond smoothly to volume in near real-time. Make sure the DMX frame rate (`DMX_FPS=30` by default) is sufficient for your needs – 30 Hz (\~33ms) frame spacing is generally fine for smooth dimming and beat synchronization. If faster strobe effects are needed, you might increase this to 40-44 FPS (the code’s DMX thread will handle it). In testing, verify that beat hits (snare/kick flashes, etc.) occur in time with the music. The code already debounces and limits print output to avoid lag, so the fundamentals are in place. It’s mostly about fine-tuning performance so that no significant delay or frame drop occurs between an audio event and the DMX action.

## DMX Fixture Mapping and DDF Consistency

* **Address/Mode Mismatch:** There is a discrepancy between the configured DMX devices in software and the actual fixture modes as per the device list. The **Device List** shows: House Lights are 5-channel mode at addresses 001–005, 010–014, 019–023; Karaoke lights are 7-channel mode at 030–036 and 041–047; Overhead pars are 10-channel at 055–064 and 069–078; the PixieWash moving head is in 23-channel “full” mode at 085–107. However, the code’s `DEVICES` setup (in **parameters.py**) instantiates different modes: it uses `Prolights_LumiPar12UAW5_7ch` for house lights, `...7UTRI_8ch` for karaoke, `...12UQPro_9ch` for overhead, and `PixieWash_13ch` for the moving head. These modes don’t match the actual fixture settings (e.g. house lights expecting 5 channels vs code sending 7). This will cause channels to be mis-mapped. For example, the house light fixtures in 5-ch mode won’t respond to the 6th and 7th channel values the software tries to send (those channels might be interpreted as nothing or control something unintended). Similarly, the PixieWash in 23-ch mode will only have its first 13 channels controlled by the program – meaning additional features (like extended color or movement channels from 14–23) stay at 0.
* **Consequence:** Because of these mismatches, certain lights might not behave correctly. House Lights may not dim or color as expected during intermissions or song transitions if the wrong channels are addressed. The moving head might not turn on some LEDs or movement functions if the program assumes a simpler mode. Additionally, the overhead lights in 10-ch mode have an extra channel that the code isn’t controlling – if that channel is important (e.g. a mode or UV channel), the fixture might require a non-zero value to operate in full, or it may default to a different behavior. In short, the show might look incomplete or incorrect because the software’s channel assumptions don’t line up with the fixtures’ actual DMX channel layout.
* **Group Configuration:** Another issue is that most fixtures are commented out in the `DEVICES` list, leaving only one “Overhead Effects” device at address 1 as a test. This means the controller is currently only aware of that single fixture; all other groups (House Lights, Karaoke, Moving Head, Smoke) have no devices. As a result, any scenario updates targeting those groups do nothing. For instance, the **Intermission** scenario is supposed to bring up house lights to 20% warm white, but if no house light fixtures are configured, that DMX command is never sent anywhere. The same goes for smoke bursts – the scenarios set values for the “Smoke Machine” group, but if the smoke machine device isn’t in `DEVICES`, there’s no actual DMX channel mapped to trigger. This could give the impression that the system “is not functioning” when in reality the code is running but not controlling any fixtures for those groups.
* **Recommendations:** **Align the code configuration with the actual hardware.** The simplest fix is to update the `DEVICES` list to use the correct fixture classes and channel counts that match your devices’ mode settings, and then include all of them so the groups are populated. For example, if you want to keep the house lights in 5-channel mode, you should implement a `Prolights_LumiPar12UAW5_5ch` class (or similar) with the appropriate CHANNEL\_OFFSETS and use that for addresses 1, 10, 19. The same goes for the 7UTRI fixtures – either switch them to 8-channel mode physically or create a 7-channel class. Given that you have DDF files for these modes, it’s feasible to add code classes: e.g. a 5-ch class for 12UAW (using Amber, Warm White, Cool White, Strobe, Dimmer as channels) and a 23-ch class for the PixieWash (covering all extended channels). If coding those is not desirable, an alternative is to change the fixture DIP switches to the modes the software already knows. Setting all fixtures to their “extended” modes (7ch for 12UAW5, 8ch for 7UTRI, 9ch for 12UQPro, 13ch for PixieWash) would let you use the existing classes. You’d then need to adjust their start addresses so they don’t overlap. For instance, if House Lights #1 goes to 7-ch mode, it will occupy 001–007; your next house light could start at 008 or 009 (the table’s 010 would leave a gap, but that’s okay). What matters is consistency between the code and device.
* **Verify Address Ranges:** Double-check that the DMX addresses in the code match those on the fixtures. The provided list suggests some padding (gaps) between fixture addresses – this is okay (DMX channels can be left unused) but make sure no two fixtures overlap. After updating the `DEVICES` list, print out `ctrl.groups` at runtime (or observe the dashboard group values) to confirm each group has the expected number of fixtures. Each group update (house, overhead, etc.) should then send DMX values to all fixtures in that group. This will activate the intended lights for each scenario. In summary, the DMX mapping should be one of the first things fixed – getting this right will likely resolve a lot of “no response” or incorrect lighting behavior issues.

## Error Handling and Logging

* **Silent Failures:** As noted, certain background operations fail quietly. Besides the genre thread mentioned earlier, the DMX output thread suppresses exceptions from the `pre_send` callback. If an error occurred while adjusting the overhead dimmer in `_update_overhead_from_vu`, the code would `pass` over it with no log. Similarly, there is no explicit catch around the low-level serial write – if the DMX USB interface disconnects or times out, the `_loop` thread could terminate without any notice. This could lead to the lights freezing without an obvious cause in the logs. It’s good that `DmxSerial.open()` sets an error flag if the port can’t be opened initially, and the dashboard does report that on startup (e.g. “DMX Error, COM4 not available”). However, after the show is running, there’s no equivalent error report for runtime issues.
* **Smoke Machine Handling:** The smoke machine is configured in scenarios (with a 30s gap and 5s duration by default) and the beat handler toggles it on and off based on timers. But currently `self.smoke` remains `None` because the smoke device was not added to `DEVICES`. The code safely checks for `self.smoke is not None` before trying to use it, so in effect all smoke triggers are skipped. This is not an error per se (there’s no crash), but it is a functional gap – you won’t get any smoke until the device is instantiated.
* **Recommendations:** Improve logging and resilience for these cases. For the DMX thread, consider logging any exception in `pre_send` instead of suppressing it. Even a simple `print("Pre-send error:", exc)` would help during debugging if something goes wrong in `_update_overhead_from_vu`. Likewise, you might wrap the `self.serial.send(frame)` call in a try/except and set `self.serial.error` if an exception is caught. That way, the dashboard’s status could flip to an error message if the DMX output stops (currently, `ctrl.serial.error` is only set on init, but you could update it on write failures and check it periodically). For the smoke machine, decide if it’s going to be used and then handle it accordingly: if yes, add the `(WhatSoftware_Generic_4ch, 115, "Smoke Machine")` device back into the list (assuming your DMX interface for the fogger is at address 115). If not, you might want to remove the smoke references from scenarios or at least log “Smoke not active” so you know those calls are being dropped intentionally. In testing, pay attention to the console output and the `vu_dimmer.log`. The log currently records VU level and dimmer values for the overheads – you might extend this to log genre decisions or state changes for a fuller picture. For example, logging each state transition and scenario change (with timestamps) to the file can greatly aid in diagnosing the sequence of events when the system “does nothing.” Ensure that every important action either reflects on the dashboard or in a log so that no failure remains completely hidden.

## Execution Flow & State Transitions

* **Intermission, Start, End Sequence:** The high-level flow of song states (Intermission -> Song Start -> Song Ongoing -> Song Ending -> back to Intermission) is implemented in the `BeatDetector` and handled in `BeatDMXShow`. The detection logic for these transitions is sound – it uses an amplitude threshold and timers to decide when a song has started or ended. The `BeatDMXShow._handle_state_change` then maps these to lighting scenarios and triggers classification at the appropriate time. The intended sequence of lighting cues is: during **INTERMISSION** – house lights on, all effects off; **SONG\_START** – as soon as music is loud for 2s, turn off house lights, set stage for a new song (moving head on performer, etc.); **SONG\_ONGOING** – after classification, apply genre-specific colors and effects; **SONG\_ENDING** – when music stops for 3s, move head to crowd, bring up house lights to 50%; then back to **INTERMISSION**. This design is clearly laid out in the scenario definitions and the README descriptions, and those states are being detected correctly by the audio code.
* **Issues in Practice:** The main problem observed is not that the state isn’t detected, but that sometimes the lighting doesn’t follow the state because of the scenario logic restrictions discussed above. For example, if no genre scenario was ever set (stuck in Song Start), the transition to Song Ending might be skipped, resulting in the *Ending* cues not running at all. You might notice in such a case that the dashboard shows “State: Ending” but the lights remain as they were. Another scenario: if the system goes to “Ending” and then back to “Starting” (perhaps the crowd noise triggered a false re-start), the *Song Start* lighting might not re-trigger due to the transition rule from Ending -> Start being disallowed. These edge cases can make the execution flow feel unreliable.
* **Improvements:** After adjusting the scenario transition logic (as suggested, by easing or forcing certain transitions), test the full flow with actual audio to ensure each stage triggers the correct lights. It may help to simulate scenarios: for instance, play a short loud sound (<2s) to simulate a song that aborts – the system should go to STARTING then back to INTERMISSION, and the house lights should ultimately return. Conversely, simulate a song with a quiet bridge: have music playing, then silence for \~4 seconds (to trigger ENDING), then resume music – the system should go to ENDING (house lights up) and then back to STARTING/ONGOING (house lights off again, possibly a new genre classification if it treats it as a new song). Currently that specific flow might not work until the transition rules are fixed. Once they are, the execution flow should cover all major transitions robustly. **Recommendation:** use the dashboard readings and log to verify that every time the state changes, the intended `_set_scenario` call actually goes through. If something says “State changed to Ending” on the console, you should also see a “DMX update for House Lights…” message or dashboard group update for house lights at that moment. If not, it means the scenario didn’t apply. Tweak the `Scenario` predecessors/successors or use `force=True` in those moments to guarantee the sequence of intermission/start/ongoing/ending lighting cues always executes in order. This will make the show feel much more consistent and responsive to the music’s lifecycle.
